# E-Commerce Back End

## The Task

To create a functional e-commerce back end to allow CRUD operations to be performed to manipulate the database

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- Express implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a functional API that follows those criteria
- The use of API's and handling their data
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it
- A deeper understanding of MySQL and using Express to manipulate a database

## Installation

This project is a back end project and is not deployed. To run this project yourself, clone the repo, add a .env file and run the installations and sql seeding. Then you can perform CRUD operations on the API.

## Usage

This project can be used in a website to allow a basic ecommerce site to run. There are other components of the site that can be used for reference, such as the methods and logic used in the API.


## Credits

This project was done in conjunction with the University of Sydney and Trilogy Education through their collaborated full stack bootcamp program. The OpenWeather API was used in this web application.
